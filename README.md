## Going Mobile!

You may want to wrap the App into a native mobile App. Given you already have Cordova and an Android or iOS SDK installed in your system, run:


```
quasar wrap cordova
cordova platform add android
cordova run android
```

For full details, take a look to the Quasar [guide](http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-wrapper.html).
